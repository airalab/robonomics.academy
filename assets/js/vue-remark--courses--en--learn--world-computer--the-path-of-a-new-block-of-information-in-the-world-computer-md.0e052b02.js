The process that describes the path of an information block in the world computer. Let's start again by returning to the theme of web3 and the concept of blockchain. The phrase \\\"block\\\" or \\\"information block\\\" can be considered identical when stepping away from the last 10 years and taking a more general theory, as explored in the previous parts of the lectures. The concept of a \\\"block of information\\\" aligns with web3, but not necessarily with blockchain. Even without any crypto projects, we need to understand that when forming the theory of the world computer without referencing the formation of information blocks, it's currently challenging to envision other models. So, we will consider the path of an information block throughout the entire world computer, not because it is blockchain, but because, for now, there are no other ways to conceptualize the existence of the world computer other than by processing information in specific portions.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Block of information = block in web3, but without blockchain and without any crypto project influence. We must currently consider the formation of information blocks when discussing the theory of the world computer. Now, let's move on to the first point. I tried to find close analogies from everyday life to help illustrate the path of an information block in the world computer. The analogy I've chosen is the movement of a bus on a route. Our first meeting point is the bus station.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"I marked transactions in pink as small dots. Let's imagine a typical bus stop where people gather, waiting for a bus that operates on a schedule. If we don't consider the hustle and bustle of large cities, where buses are always late, everyone in the world generally knows that the train from village A to village B always arrives around 7:15 am. Transactions that users want to send to the world computer gather at a certain bus stop and wait for the bus to arrive.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"This is how our block is formed. Imagine: the bus arrives, and each person starts boarding one by one, taking their seats. The bus then follows its route. In our case, the block of information overcomes the first frontier. Our transactions, in some form, have settled into the bus and overcome the initial barrier. I will be using terminology primarily from Polkadot, and the third part should have better explained the concept of the world computer in the comparison between Ethereum and Polkadot. My personal opinion, and probably the majority of engineers today would agree, is that the representation of a heterogeneous multicentric world computer is better implemented in Polkadot. However, we will still go through the terms inherited from Ethereum, but towards the end of this part of the lecture.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"What is the line that separates the bus stop from the bus's further movement? This line represents the collators of the network – participants in the network nodes who collect transactions. You can think of a collator not as a bus driver but as a controller who stays at the bus stop. In other words, this controller checks whether you have a ticket when you enter the bus. It doesn't recheck in the database how valid the ticket is but looks at the basic parameters of the ticket and checks if everything seems fine. In reality, collators perform almost all the calculations required, verifying the ticket number and other data, but they are not required to guarantee that the check is done correctly. Therefore, collators are controllers who remain at the bus stop, primarily ensuring passenger boarding, seating, and sending the bus further along the route.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Beyond the drawn border, we enter the first validation area where paravalidators are located. These are validators of the entire ecosystem, the entire network, specifically assigned for a certain time to check each transaction and thus perform actual computations in the world computer. Our not-yet-fully-formed block of information is marked with a dashed line. It is still a candidate block of information since it has not undergone any actual verification. The collator, who collected the block of information and checked the transactions at the entrance, does not participate in any way in securing the cybersecurity of the computations conducted. Its task is only to seat all transactions and form the first block. At this stage, the transformation from a candidate to a real block of information begins.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"I have divided it into three parts, but forgot one more. Let's consider four parts of this candidate block. The top part, known to users of various web3 applications as the header or block header, is the quintessence, the most popular piece of information circulating and reflected from the block explorer to the console clients of all nodes mining, staking, and so on. The header is a key element of the block, but it is practically formed at the last stage at this point.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Firstly, we have our actual requests for state transitions or computations. There is a list of changes that need to be made: convert A to A', B to B', C to C', applying a set of algorithms to them. For this, we will now build another boundary immediately and go beyond it to perform this part of the work, and then only proceed beyond it. Already at the block preparation stage, we have to cross the second boundary within the world computer to go for the algorithms that need to be applied to prepare the block. As I mentioned before, theoretically, the controller at the bus stop here does the same, but I wouldn't pay much attention to that. The block preparation stage, especially when we talk about examples simultaneously from Polkadot and Ethereum as a world computer, they differ slightly and show us the insignificance of checks at this stage because it is precisely on the second step, after passing the first boundary and receiving the block of information from collators, that the attention-worthy calculations of this world computer begin.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"To perform these calculations, the validator, at this stage, can only do so by turning to the relay chain, the central database, and taking from there the algorithms from the runtime. In the case of Ethereum, it was the same virtual machines in the previous architectural concept, which could be applied, so there was no need to go anywhere. Almost every node had a complete copy of the algorithms that could be applied. But in terms of a heterogeneous network, where each segment or each individual chain may have its own set of algorithms, a validator, before actually executing all the transitions, calculations obtained in the form of a block candidate from the collator, must consult. It must consult the relay chain, consult the main blockchain in the network and take from there the necessary algorithms, apply them, and perform state transitions.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"During the execution of calculations, a Merkle tree is simultaneously formed, and we won't dwell on it because Merkle trees are not that complicated from the perspective of computer science. Still, I notice that to understand how to apply them in engineering and in the architecture of a project, how they are applied, not just by reading on Wikipedia, you need to break your head a bit, imagine examples. In this example, we won't delve too much into it, but I think for those who are already familiar with some basic definitions, have read about Merkle trees, it will become a bit clearer about how and at what moments another Merkle tree is assembled. The Merkle tree is formed when we actually perform calculations and output values appear. These output values are packed into a binary tree format, then the addition is performed between them in computer science language, and the top node reaches the header. Let's denote it with a big letter \\\"H.\\\" It's a small and pleasant aspect of considering such schemes.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"In this scheme, we can note how the block header is actually related to the computations performed inside. Let's look again - our block candidate came from the collator. There is a set of transactions that need to be executed, perform calculations. The validator went through another internal boundary, one more, behind the algorithms, applied them, and recorded all the results at the lowest level of the Merkle tree. The other nodes are essentially systemic. They do not come from any data; they don't come from anywhere. At the second level, the node does not come from any information. It is obtained by summing values in these two leaves, and when we go up with you, we get only the root of this tree, which is enough to protect all output values. We won't get the same header if we change any of these calculations. And this is one of the magical and simple features, like hash-oriented storage, of how we can protect a whole block of information by talking only about one header. Therefore, headers are so important and play a cornerstone role even in architectures when we transition from one chain or one virtual machine to many combined in the network. It is enough for us to ensure the security of storing headers to be sure that all transactions that were executed at the block preparation stage were executed correctly, and they cannot be replaced.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"And one field is still left unfilled. In the process of preparing the block of information, it is the author's field, that is, the validator who actually performed all the changes, prepared the Merkle tree, and recorded the header. Since we are considering an example with the bus moving along the route from the stop, let's call the validator a \\\"controller\\\" who goes right inside the bus, passes each seat, approaches each person, checks for real what is written on their tickets, makes some mark, validates it, and, accordingly, puts their signature. The controller, for example, number 134, meaning, naturally, each validator has some unique identifier, their address, and we also somehow uniquely renamed it here.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"And it seems that at this point, we could have shaded and made our block boundaries bolder, but no, and this is one of the interesting changes that have occurred in the last 5 years in terms of decentralized ecosystems, namely the shift from proof of work. When validators of the network, at that time miners, never had to coordinate anything with each other. You produced a block and sent it to the network and moved on. In fact, it was not a consensus of agreed consent. It was a consensus of obvious agreement with the fact that had occurred. What is interesting changes when the architecture becomes more complex, and we have come closer from a simple calculator like Bitcoin with a ledger towards an actual virtual computer, is that at each stage, the connectivity of participants who ensure security and block production has increased. Because, in fact, no one who risks their stake, the one who ensures this security and wants to earn by processing your transactions, has something to lose, unlike proof of work. In proof of work, you bought the equipment, yes, you put money into it, you spend electricity, but there is actually no protection against the fact that you can attack the network with your power, the same 51% attack, where someone with a lot of miners can try to rewrite the chain.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Now we are talking about proof of stake, where a deposit is already made, and if you do something wrong, a part will be withdrawn from it, as a penalty. All nodes, absolutely, in all architectures that I currently observe, mechanisms for messaging between validators began to appear quickly at the block preparation stage. In Polkadot, it is no different. Any validator of a separate parachain that collects a block knows the addresses or already has established contact with another 15-63 validators who are with you on this epoch, on some temporary period, as validators, and each of them randomly becomes a block producer at some point. But being appointed as a producer does not negate a very important component of this process. You do not stop interacting with the other participants. There is always a pool of validators assigned to a specific epoch, to a certain time slot, for validating a particular parachain or segment of the world computer. Regardless of whether you are a validator-controller specifically assigned to produce the next block in the world computer of this segment, you still stay in touch with the other validators, and you have constant contact with them.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Why is this constant contact necessary? It turns out to be quite simple. We do not want, when we move into the inner part, to be afraid or worry that we performed any of the operations incorrectly. As surprising as it may seem, it is beneficial for any validator, before moving on, to first turn to their colleagues assigned to validation and ask them to double-check the calculations. This check is informal, so even if we do not use any logging into an immutable database of requests for verification and the results of this verification, the appointed controller, after talking to the pool of validators, still collects additional responses from all validators assigned to this parachain or network segment. Together with additional confirmations, the controller moves on to the next stage. But even here, it's not quite as simple. At this stage, another process has to be performed. It is important to note that at this stage, our block of information is still a candidate block, and settlement of information is already taking place in the storage. Neither at the very end, nor after we have created and sealed the block and attached it with an archiver in the final part, namely here, in this middle part where all the calculations are actually performed, does the information get saved in the storage. Therefore, our controller, in addition to talking to their colleagues, also ensures the storage of data in some storage, which is also quite metaphysical because the moment you communicate with other validators, this storage gets filled. How is this checked? We will need to move on to the next stage.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"In summary, to complete the middle part, let's look again. We still have only a candidate block at the very beginning. Yes, all transactions are roughly calculated somewhere at the bus stop, everyone has taken their seats according to their tickets. We have passed the first boundary, which is essentially direct established contact between validators and block collators. In Ethereum and Polkadot, these are slightly different schemes now. But everything that happens on the left side at the very beginning does not provide cybersecurity for data and calculations. It's just preparation. Once we have passed and entered the environment of the validators' attention, work with the block of information in the world computer begins. A randomly selected validator, in our case, with a bus route - a controller, actually goes through each of the seats, checks the ticket, checks and performs all the calculations that were made, gathers all the information into a tree. The resulting root node of this tree becomes the header of the proposed block. The validator who actually performs all the calculations with this block of information communicates with the other participants who perform a similar function for the same route in an undefined time slot. And while communicating with them and asking them to verify all the calculations, we are actually filling a certain storage of data in the network. It is not a specific physical storage; there is no specific IP address, no specific hard drive onto which they all load through some VPN or login and password scheme, of course not. In the process of communicating with other validators, data remains on their local machines, and this data will further participate in the transformation of this candidate into a new block of information. In essence, the sealed block that will be settled in the relay chain is collected. We have assembled a block. All the metadata around the calculations is already filled, which means we can try to move on to the next frontier.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"At this moment, let's delve into the passage of the next boundary. The most crucial aspect at the final stage becomes the block header. We are less concerned with the execution of computations; we can simplify our perspective here, as computations may vary based on the architecture, whether it's Ethereum or Polkadot. The key point is that, on the intermediate stage, from what I observe in the theory and practice of implementing the world computer concept, most computations happen at an intermediate level. The last level remains only to execute essential checks. Almost all these checks in a multi-chain architecture are related to the concatenation or merging of block headers into one block.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"In the final part of our journey, the most important element in the world computer's information block becomes the cornerstone – the header. The second component is more about meta-information. If the header is the actual result of all computations, the additional meta-information being transmitted consists of receipts and signatures of the validators who participated in the intermediate stage of this process. At the final stage, we can visualize the whole picture solely as the assembly of the same tree, not as a list of transactions. In the relay chain's final part, the crucial aspect is the assembly of headers from many similar processes, but linked to different segments of the world computer, different parachains.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Each parachain, each set of validators – we've discussed one example, but in reality, such block preparations for parachains happen 30-40 times. The number of parachain slots or the number of L2 networks in Ethereum will result in a similar number of processes with a similar architecture. However, in the final stage, we will see an approximately identical picture everywhere – how the block header will be formed from a multitude of headers from other blocks. In this process, we need to introduce one more entity and jump back across the boundary to the second stage.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Finalizers. In fact, they are also validators, but relay chain validators. In the Polkadot architecture, we have a thousand validators divided into two groups. The first, a very small group, is responsible only for forming the block header and a new block consisting of the headers of the State of the States blocks. The second group – parachain validators – is further divided into many subgroups, but this group is called parachain validators. In L2 networks above Ethereum, this story will eventually gain more understanding, more denominators. For now, let's focus on the Polkadot architecture. Finalizers, besides checking an additional set of meta-information and rechecking a validator with a specific ID, randomly chosen to generate this block of all blocks, also help recheck meta-information, check, and assemble all headers into one. It's a bit complex, yes, if we look at it from the perspective of tree assembly.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"In addition to this, in the Polkadot architecture and in Ethereum with the latest changes, a data availability check takes place. For this, finalizers visit parachain validators and try to request actual information about each block stored in the network. If they receive data from at least 1/3 of the validators, using technology that allows redundant storage of information, and subsequently, if someone loses it, one or two or three validators can still restore it, there is a critical threshold at 1/3. If 1/3 of the nodes respond and say that we have data about the block being produced, finalizers tell the block that it is already a fully formed information block, that all computations have been done correctly, that we have already taken the header of this block and combined it with someone else's headers from other segments of the network. We have already formed the main header of the entire network. After that, finalizers place many checkmarks on the final block, which combines all performed computations.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Currently, this is the situation from the perspective of the most engineering-implemented multi-chain heterogeneous ecosystem, which is Polkadot. It is the most engineering-implemented multi-chain heterogeneous ecosystem, not too far from Ethereum. I would like to focus on the comparison, and if someone is interested in understanding how information blocks flow in Ethereum with L2 networks, you can try to do that now. I will return to this question when some elements of Ethereum, in terms of heterogeneity and multi-chain aspects, are completed. It might take 1-2 years, and then we can build such a picture.

This concludes the theoretical part. I think it took about 2 hours, and ahead of us are practical sessions that I will be recording over the next few months. They will help us understand the observed data from the console window, decentralized applications, block explorers, where we will gradually understand how all these theoretical numbers and letters actually look in implementation using Polkadot as an example.
