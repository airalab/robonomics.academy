At such moments of global anxiety, the truth, imperceptible in the daily life of big cities, is exposed. Technologies are already inexorably entering into our lives and very often technology becomes intertwined with our lives more deeply than some of us individually would like. Yes, there is a long-standing and difficult question from the field of philosophy about the opposition of the public and the private. But still, we want to implement and help grow web3 in the field of IoT now at an early stage, so that it would not be possible to change the name of everyone on the planet to an identification code in an instant and without their consent. The new generation of Internet technologies will help improve the relationship between humans and machines, make smart devices more independent and faster in providing services to people, and importantly, not give control of one person over another with the help of machines.
