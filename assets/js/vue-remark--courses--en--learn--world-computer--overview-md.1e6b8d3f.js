What capabilities and responsibilities does the user have when dealing with an application that exists not only on their phone but also in some infrastructure beyond their pocket or palm?

It also prevents users from being in a situation where they don't understand how an app works on their phone. In my opinion, these are important and cool features deserving respect and attention from those who want to create more futuristic, cooler applications.

By 2012, besides Bitcoin, its so-called forks start appearing. One of the most well-known is Litecoin.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Litecoin is notable because its developer did the most important work for the entire community.

However, Namecoin turned out to be a bit different, paving the way for many developers mentally on where ideas underlying Bitcoin's internet service could evolve. Namecoin went beyond being just a coin; it could store identity as a database and allow an internet service to place your domain name. This was the first example where an internet service spawned from Bitcoin could have a different nature, not just like Litecoin with fast transactions but the ability to pay for storing certain information with its internal currency, an internal token. For example, the name in the .bit domain zone.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Developers worldwide were experimenting with Bitcoin, mostly creating forks, making them faster, cheaper electronic cash. Alongside this, the first services appeared, seeing opportunities not only in financial applications but also in cross-industrial applications in other areas like Namecoin. Namecoin provided the first globally accessible and unowned internet service through which you could launch your website without being under the jurisdiction of a specific organization but within a distributed globally accessible network. This moment is crucial for us to move on to the early precursors of the world computer's ideas.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"The first practical ideas of the world computer emerged in 2014, two years after the appearance of the first wave of Bitcoin forks and the creation of meaningful services dedicated not only to electronic cash but also exploring broader themes. We encounter ideas that precede the launch of Ethereum.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"In 2014, at several meetups worldwide, in Miami and, I believe, in Europe, Vitalik Buterin articulated sensible ideas. He suggests that we can develop not just a set of internet services that essentially function as a Swiss army knife, right? We can develop a virtual machine. Those with an education in Computer Science probably remember what an infinite tape is in Turing machines, and if we go back to the theory of computational machines, we probably recall the theoretical origins of creating our personal computers, essentially the server infrastructure we have today. It's interesting that, fifty years after the development of von Neumann architecture and the complete Turing machine theory, and with the dawn of internet technologies only by 2014, and only after experiments with Bitcoin, the first idea emerges on our planet of creating a fully virtual computational machine based on the same theory that has been tested in the computer science industry for the past 50 years. The mechanics are the same as when creating any personal computer or server in a data center, but based more on achievements in internet technologies and the achievements of the world that will later be called Web3.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Ethereum itself is not a Swiss army knife, not a set of specific internet services. It is, in the direct sense, a cloud, a computational machine. What lies at its core, I will tell you in the next lecture. Here, the most important thing for us is to focus on where the idea of Ethereum began. It started with the realization that, in two years, dozens of different internet services were invented that were interesting because they were globally accessible, available without censorship for developers to deploy. Users could use them only with an internal currency. However, what was not liked in all these concepts was that almost every interesting service required its own massive distributed infrastructure. Unlike familiar internet services, you couldn't just launch your globally accessible infrastructure if you were a very small person or a small team because such a network would be vulnerable, and the service itself would become unsafe. To overcome the problems that were side effects or negative externalities of creating your own globally accessible sovereign internet service, the concept of Ethereum emerged. Ethereum, as a full-fledged cloud capable of handling any formalized computation, allows you to write your program code, a complete program essentially, and run it in the same blockchain alongside hundreds of other applications. This possibility, sounding from the small stages of 2014, naturally captivated the minds of many and seemed absolutely logical for someone with a basic education in Computer Science. If you could understand what Turing completeness was by 2014, if you could envision the historical theory of creating a personal computer, you would definitely not overlook the Ethereum whitepaper and would say that this is exactly what the entire developer community needs.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"I believe the year 2014 and Ethereum mark the first, though not explicitly named, instances of the concept of a global computer. It started with the idea that we don't need a Swiss knife; instead, we need infrastructure or a universal cloud that addresses global-level security challenges. Developers, at a low cost, should be able to deploy their applications there without concerning themselves with issues like securing the network or creating a network of providers for this computer or your specific internet service.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"In 2015, Ethereum was effectively launched. From that moment onwards, even until 2020, I haven't encountered significant counterarguments against the idea of creating not just specific internet services but embracing and developing the concept of a virtual computer, virtual server, cloud, or a global computer, as I prefer to call it.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Various variations emerge, perhaps some remember the then-popular EOS suggesting a slightly different consumption paradigm. Despite my personal aversion to that project, with its 21st validator and all, it seemed sufficient for many. But it introduced the idea that owning tokens grants you a portion of bandwidth, which, in the realm of Robonomics architecture, remains interesting to me to this day.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Simultaneously, other ideas on how to modernize the Ethereum network arise. Projects like Definity, Solana, and others come into play. Around the same time, Gavin Wood introduces Polkadot, who assisted Vitalik in creating Ethereum. From a multitude of technological projects between 2015 and 2020, we move from a race to create individual internet service variants to witnessing, on a communication protocol level, the emergence of something like Ethereum killers. Many projects started under this slogan, taking the idea of a unified cloud for multiple internet services and modifying some aspects. For instance, EOS proposed an alternative utilization scheme, where only token-backed ownership allowed access to bandwidth. There were projects where the programming language for writing code was more interesting. For example, during a hackathon for BMW, when we won with an implementation on Ethereum, the automaker immediately stated that we wouldn't go any further unless we had formally verified contracts, which was impossible to achieve on Ethereum at that time.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"At this moment, as you read about the ideas of Eternity and other networks, you may think, \\\"I should try working with them too.\\\" Service developers understood this, as did, as I mentioned, projects like Definity, which recently launched the World Computer and is gaining traction. Simultaneously, the idea of Polkadot emerges as a heterogeneous multi-chain framework. Ethereum, around the mid-2010s, also received a roadmap for scalability and development. By 2024, almost all concepts converge on the idea of having not just one database or blockchain but a multitude. Various transaction processing methods, two-layer consensus algorithms, optimistic majority approaches, and a plethora of technical implementation variations emerge, all aiming at the same global computer concept.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Let's now go through a timeline snapshot:\")]),_c('ul',[_c('li',[_c('strong',[_vm._v(\"2009-2012\")]),_vm._v(\": Emergence of the first globally accessible internet service for electronic cash - Bitcoin. \")]),_c('li',[_c('strong',[_vm._v(\"Early 2012\")]),_vm._v(\": The first fork war occurs, with projects emerging to replicate similar services.
