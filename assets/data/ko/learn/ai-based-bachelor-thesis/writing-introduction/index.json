The bachelor completed an online course called \"Smart Home Sovereign\". In this course, the bachelor went through all the steps necessary to build a sovereign smart home, the main advantage of which is the security / privacy of user data. During the course, The bachelor set up an IoT hub on a Raspberry Pi and connected smart devices (such as a temperature/humidity sensor, a door sensor, a smart bulb, a motion sensor, etc.) to it via a 지그비 어댑터 using the MQTT protocol. The IoT hub is powered by Home Assistant software. Next, the bachelor connected the hub to a decentralized cloud, based on Polkadot web3 technology. This is necessary to securely transfer device data to the network without the need for a centralized cloud service provider. This allows to securely manage the home remotely\"\n\n*Goal 2:* Write an 소개duction part for this thesis in 500 words.

A smart home system consists of a network of interconnected devices that can sense, communicate, and act on various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, motion, light, and sound. These devices can be controlled remotely or operate autonomously based on predefined rules and algorithms. \\\\n\\\\nHowever, smart home systems also present significant challenges and risks in terms of data privacy and security. Most smart home devices rely on centralized cloud platforms to store and process the data they collect from users' homes, which exposes users to potential data breaches, unauthorized access, surveillance, manipulation, or misuse by third parties such as hackers, service providers, governments, or advertisers. Furthermore, users often have limited control and ownership over their data, as they are required to agree to the terms and conditions of the cloud providers, which may not respect their preferences or rights. \\\\n\\\\nWeb3 technology refers to a suite of decentralized technologies that use blockchain to enable secure, transparent, and immutable transactions and records without intermediaries or central authorities. This allows for the creation of trustless, compromise-resistant IoT networks, and supports the creation of decentralized applications (dapps) that run on top of the blockchain. This enables users to transact in a secure and decentralized manner. \\\\n\\\\nThe main goal of this bachelor's thesis is to design a smart home system that is both secure and private. This system will use web3 technologies to create a decentralized, sovereign ecosystem. To achieve this goal, this work will explore the use of a Raspberry Pi as an IoT hub, connected to various smart home devices using the MQTT protocol. Then, a decentralized cloud based on Polkadot web3 technology will be integrated into the IoT system. This will enable secure and private data transfer between the smart home devices. Finally, the privacy and security implications of this setup will be evaluated and compared to traditional smart home setups that rely on centralized cloud vendors. \\\\n\\\\nThe significance of this study lies in its exploration of the use of Web3 technologies to design a secure and private smart home system. This work identifies the potential benefits and challenges of using Web3 technologies in smart homes. By examining these issues, this study contributes to the development of guidelines for the use of these technologies in IoT environments.'}\n\n**SYSTEM:**  Command write_to_file returned: File written to successfully.\n\n</RoboAcademyTerminal>\n\n에이전트 로그에 따르면, 텍스트를 쓰기 전에 정보를 찾는 데 시간을 소비했습니다. 게다가, 에이전트는 소개를 점진적으로 만들어가며 단어 제한을 충족시키기 위해 텍스트를 추가했습니다.\n\n### 출력 개선\n\n전반적으로, AI는 소개를 기반으로 사용할 만큼 작업을 잘 수행했습니다. 또한 **Notion AI**에 텍스트를 입력하여 (`글쓰기 개선` 또는 `어조 변경` 도구 사용) 더 개선할 수도 있습니다.\n\n<RoboAcademyText>\n일반적으로, 소개 섹션에는 이미 관련 작품의 소스를 추가해야 하지만, 소스를 검색하고 분석하기 전에 다음 가이드 — 문헌 검토를 먼저 살펴보는 것이 좋습니다.\n</RoboAcademyText>","fileInfo":{"path":"ko/learn/ai-based-bachelor-thesis/writing-introduction.md","name":"writing-introduction"},"defaultName":"Quickstart Your Bachelor's Thesis with AI-powered Tools","lastUpdate":null}},"context":{}}
