The bachelor completed an online course called \"Smart Home Sovereign\". In this course, the bachelor went through all the steps necessary to build a sovereign smart home, the main advantage of which is the security / privacy of user data. During the course, The bachelor set up an IoT hub on a Raspberry Pi and connected smart devices (such as a temperature/humidity sensor, a door sensor, a smart bulb, a motion sensor, etc.) to it via a Zigbee适配器 using the MQTT protocol. The IoT hub is powered by Home Assistant software. Next, the bachelor connected the hub to a decentralized cloud, based on Polkadot web3 technology. This is necessary to securely transfer device data to the network without the need for a centralized cloud service provider. This allows to securely manage the home remotely\"\n\n*Goal 2:* Write an 介绍duction part for this thesis in 500 words.

A smart home system consists of a network of interconnected devices that can sense, communicate, and act on various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, motion, light, and sound. These devices can be controlled remotely or operate autonomously based on predefined rules and algorithms. \\\\n\\\\nHowever, smart home systems also present significant challenges and risks in terms of data privacy and security. Most smart home devices rely on centralized cloud platforms to store and process the data they collect from users' homes, which exposes users to potential data breaches, unauthorized access, surveillance, manipulation, or misuse by third parties such as hackers, service providers, governments, or advertisers. Furthermore, users often have limited control and ownership over their data, as they are required to agree to the terms and conditions of the cloud providers, which may not respect their preferences or rights. \\\\n\\\\nWeb3 technology refers to a suite of decentralized technologies that use blockchain to enable secure, transparent, and immutable transactions and records without intermediaries or central authorities. This allows for the creation of trustless, compromise-resistant IoT networks, and supports the creation of decentralized applications (dapps) that run on top of the blockchain. This enables users to transact in a secure and decentralized manner. \\\\n\\\\nThe main goal of this bachelor's thesis is to design a smart home system that is both secure and private. This system will use web3 technologies to create a decentralized, sovereign ecosystem. To achieve this goal, this work will explore the use of a Raspberry Pi as an IoT hub, connected to various smart home devices using the MQTT protocol. Then, a decentralized cloud based on Polkadot web3 technology will be integrated into the IoT system. This will enable secure and private data transfer between the smart home devices. Finally, the privacy and security implications of this setup will be evaluated and compared to traditional smart home setups that rely on centralized cloud vendors. \\\\n\\\\nThe significance of this study lies in its exploration of the use of Web3 technologies to design a secure and private smart home system. This work identifies the potential benefits and challenges of using Web3 technologies in smart homes. By examining these issues, this study contributes to the development of guidelines for the use of these technologies in IoT environments.'}\n\n**SYSTEM:**  Command write_to_file returned: File written to successfully.\n\n</RoboAcademyTerminal>\n\n根据代理日志，在撰写文本之前，它花了一些时间搜索信息。此外，代理逐步创建介绍，逐渐添加文本以满足字数限制。\n\n### 改进输出\n\n总的来说，AI表现得足够好，可以将这段文本用作介绍的基础。还可以通过将文本输入**Notion AI**（使用`改进写作`或`改变语气`工具）来进一步改进。\n\n<RoboAcademyText>\n一般来说，在介绍部分已经需要添加相关作品的来源，但在我们继续搜索和分析来源之前，最好先阅读以下指南 — 文献综述。\n</RoboAcademyText>","fileInfo":{"path":"zh/learn/ai-based-bachelor-thesis/writing-introduction.md","name":"writing-introduction"},"defaultName":"Quickstart Your Bachelor's Thesis with AI-powered Tools","lastUpdate":null}},"context":{}}
