The study was conducted as part of an online course titled \"Smart Home Sovereign.\" The methods encompassed the setup of an IoT hub on a Raspberry Pi, connection of various smart devices to the hub using a Zigbee适配器 and the MQTT protocol, integration of the hub with Home Assistant software, and the establishment of a connection between the hub and a decentralized cloud based on Polkadot web3 technology. These steps were taken to enable secure data transfer to the network and facilitate remote home management.\n\n1\\. Online Course: \"Smart Home Sovereign\"\nThe initial phase of the study involved the completion of the online course \"Smart Home Sovereign.\" This course provided comprehensive guidance on building a sovereign smart home, emphasizing the importance of user data security and privacy. The bachelor successfully completed all the course modules, gaining a thorough understanding of the fundamental concepts and practical aspects related to the construction of a sovereign smart home.\n\n2\\. Setting up the IoT Hub\nTo establish a centralized control system for the smart home devices, an IoT hub was set up on a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi was selected due to its versatility, low cost, and compatibility with the desired functionalities. The IoT hub acted as the central communication point, facilitating the interaction between the smart devices and the user.\n\n3\\. 连接ing Smart Devices\nVarious smart devices were integrated into the sovereign smart home system. These devices included a temperature/humidity sensor, a door sensor, a smart bulb, and a motion sensor, among others. A Zigbee适配器 was utilized to connect these devices to the IoT hub, enabling seamless communication. The MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol was employed to establish a reliable and efficient communication channel between the hub and the connected devices.\n\n4\\. Integration with Home Assistant\nThe IoT hub was integrated with Home Assistant, an open-source home automation platform. Home Assistant provided a user-friendly interface for managing and controlling the connected smart devices. This integration allowed the bachelor to monitor and control the devices remotely, enhancing the convenience and functionality of the sovereign smart home system.\n\n5\\. 连接ion to Decentralized Cloud\nTo ensure secure data transfer without relying on a centralized cloud service provider, a decentralized cloud based on Polkadot web3 technology was employed. This connection facilitated the secure transfer of device data to the network, protecting user privacy and enabling remote home management. The bachelor established a connection between the IoT hub and the decentralized cloud, enabling seamless data transfer and access.\n\n6\\. Data Security and Privacy Measures\nThroughout the implementation process, stringent data security and privacy measures were implemented. The bachelor ensured the adoption of industry-standard encryption protocols and authentication mechanisms to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of the user's personal and device data. Additionally, measures such as secure network configurations and regular software updates were implemented to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and security risks.\n\n</RoboAcademyDialog>\n\n<RoboAcademyDialog>\n\n1\\. Description of the Smart Home System Design using web3 technology, including hardware and software components:\n\n\\- Describe the overall architecture of the smart home system.\n\n\\- Explain the hardware components involved, such as the Raspberry Pi, sensors, actuators, and communication modules.\n\n\\- Discuss the software components, including the operating system, middleware, and applications used to control and manage the smart home system.\n\n\\- Highlight the role of web3 technology, such as blockchain, decentralized networks, and protocols, in enhancing the security and privacy of the system.\n\n\n2\\. Implementation details and justification for design choices:\n\n\\- Provide a step-by-step account of how the smart home system was implemented, including the installation and configuration processes.\n\n\\- Justify the selection of specific hardware and software components based on their compatibility, reliability, security features, and suitability for the project's objectives.\n\n\\- Discuss any modifications or customization made to the hardware or software components to meet the specific requirements of the smart home system.\n\n\\- Explain how the chosen web3 technology (e.g., blockchain, decentralized networks) addresses security and privacy concerns compared to traditional approaches.\n\n3\\. Evaluation plan for assessing the security and privacy of the system:\n\n\\- Outline the goals and objectives of the security and privacy evaluation.\n\n\\- Identify the specific security and privacy aspects to be evaluated, such as data encryption, access control, authentication, and data integrity.\n\n\\- Describe the evaluation methods and techniques to be used, such as penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, or simulations.\n\n\\- Explain how data will be collected, analyzed, and interpreted to assess the effectiveness of the implemented security and privacy measures.\n\n\\- Discuss any ethical considerations and potential risks associated with the evaluation process.\n\n</RoboAcademyDialog>\n\n因此，最佳策略是手动从不同计划中选择项目，并逐个和分部分地输入它们。重要的是不要忘记上下文，提醒AI助手应基于源材料执行其任务。\n\n## 生成插图\n\n良好的论文能够以图形形式呈现材料，因此至少应尝试使用AI的帮助。关于不同模型的能力有很多文章，例如MidJourney、DALL-E、Stable Diffusion和其他服务，但它们主要是用于生成艺术作品，而不是严格的图表和图表。很多时候，它们无法插入确的文本，总的来说，获得的插图通常太笨拙。\n\n例如，让我们尝试在Bing Chat中创建以下内容的图表，该图表将重定向请求到Bing图像创建器:\n\n<RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nMake image with diagram based on this description:\n\nThere are 4 main blocks: Raspberry Pi, Smart Devices, Zigbee Adapter and Web3 Decentalized Cloud. Zigbee Adapter is connected by a double-ended arrow to Smart Devices, the arrow has the name \"Zigbee\".\n\nInside Raspberry Pi there are 4 more internal blocks: Zigbee2MQTT, MQTT Broker, Home Assistant and \"robonomics-interface\". Zigbee2MQTT is connected by a double-ended arrow to MQTT Broker, the arrow has the name \"MQTT\". MQTT Broker is connected by a double-ended arrow to Home Assistant, the arrow has the name \"MQTT\". Home Assistant is connected by a double-ended arrow to \"robonomics-interface\", the arrow has the name \"Robonomics Data\".\n\nAlso, internal block Zigbee2MQTT is connected by a double-ended arrow to Zigbee Adapter, the arrow has the name \"Zigbee\". Internal block \"robonomics-interface\" is connected by a double-ended arrow to Web3 Decentalized Cloud, the arrow has the name \"data & events\".\n\n</RoboAcademyDialog>\n\n结果:\n\n<robo-academy-grid :columns=\"3\" textAlign=\"center\">\n    <robo-academy-grid-element>\n      <LessonImages src=\"ai-based-bachelor-thesis/bad-diagram1.jpeg\" alt=\"Diagram example from Bing\"/>\n    </robo-academy-grid-element>\n    <robo-academy-grid-element>\n      <LessonImages src=\"ai-based-bachelor-thesis/bad-diagram2.jpeg\" alt=\"Diagram example from Bing\"/>\n    </robo-academy-grid-element/>\n    <robo-academy-grid-element>\n      <LessonImages src=\"ai-based-bachelor-thesis/bad-diagram3.jpeg\" alt=\"Diagram example from Bing\"/>\n    </robo-academy-grid-element/>\n</robo-academy-grid>\n\n最好要求创建一个图表的代码，例如在UML中，然后在图表编辑器中生成插图。例如，在ChatGPT中添加`根据此描述生成UML图表代码`的类似请求，在几次尝试后，产生了以下结果:\n\n<robo-academy-grid :columns=\"2\" textAlign=\"center\">\n    <robo-academy-grid-element>\n<LessonCodeWrapper language=\"uml\" noCopyIcon noLines codeClass=\"big-code\">\n        @startuml\n        package \"Raspberry Pi\" {\n            [Zigbee2MQTT]\n            [MQTT Broker]\n            [Home Assistant]\n            [robonomics-interface]\n        }\n        Zigbee2MQTT o--o \"MQTT Broker\" : MQTT\n        \"MQTT Broker\" o--o \"Home Assistant\" : MQTT\n        \"Home Assistant\" o--o \"robonomics-interface\" : \"Robonomics Data\"\n        rectangle \"Smart Devices\"\n        rectangle \"Zigbee Adapter\"\n        \"Zigbee Adapter\" o--o \"Smart Devices\" : Zigbee\n        \"robonomics-interface\" o--o \"Web3 Decentalized Cloud\" : \"data & events\"\n        Zigbee2MQTT o--o \"Zigbee Adapter\" : Zigbee\n        @enduml\n\n</LessonCodeWrapper>\n    </robo-academy-grid-element>\n    <robo-academy-grid-element>\n      <LessonImages src=\"ai-based-bachelor-thesis/system-diagram.png\" alt=\"Diagram after producing UML code\"/>\n    </robo-academy-grid-element/>\n</robo-academy-grid>\n\n## 生成代码\n\n虽然AI助手无法独立设置设备，但可以要求帮助编写软件。为了测试安装的智能家居软件的功能，我们决定基于一个场景为Home Assistant创建自动化。以下请求被发送到AutoGPT:\n\n<RoboAcademyTerminal title=\"AutoGPT Terminal\">\n\nAI Name: Hass-GPT \n\nHass-GPT is: an AI that creates automation scripts for Home Assistant based on the text description\n\nGoal 1: Open https://www.home-assistant.io/examples/ and analyze script codes of automations\n\nGoal 2: Create automation script code with following scenario: turn on the bulb when motion sensor detects someone; while motion is present, keep the bulb turned on; when the motion stops, turn the bulb off\n\nGoal 3: Write this code to the file and return it back\n\n</RoboAcademyTerminal>\n\n通过AutoGPT，生成了以下脚本:\n\n<LessonCodeWrapper language=\"yaml\" noCopyIcon codeClass=\"big-code\">\n    - alias: \"运动传感器 Bulb Control\"\n      trigger:\n        platform: state\n        entity_id: binary_sensor.motion_sensor\n        to: \"on\"\n      action:\n        service: light.turn_on\n        entity_id: light.bulb\n    - alias: \"Motion Sensor Bulb Keep On\"\n      trigger:\n        platform: state\n        entity_id: binary_sensor.motion_sensor\n        to: \"on\"\n      action:\n        service: light.turn_on\n        entity_id: light.bulb\n    - alias: \"Motion Sensor Bulb Off\"\n      trigger:\n        platform: state\n        entity_id: binary_sensor.motion_sensor\n        to: \"off\"\n        for:\n          minutes: 1\n      action:\n        service: light.turn_off\n        entity_id: light.bulb\n</LessonCodeWrapper>\n\n当然，脚本需要针对特定传感器和设备实体进行额外调整，但总体上请求被正确处理。\n\n<RoboAcademyText>\n\n因此，实践表明，尽管AI无法完全独立处理这一部分，但它至少可以在某些任务上提供很大的帮助或提供解决方案的想法。在下一节中，我们将探讨AI工具如何帮助分析获得的结果并格式化相应部分。\n\n</RoboAcademyText>","fileInfo":{"path":"zh/learn/ai-based-bachelor-thesis/writing-methods.md","name":"writing-methods"},"defaultName":"Quickstart Your Bachelor's Thesis with AI-powered Tools","lastUpdate":null}},"context":{}}
