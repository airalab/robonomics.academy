It’s time to take a closer look at the functions of Robonomics parachain as a part of the Polkadot ecosystem in the Kusama network. In particular, we would like to show how IoT subscriptions of the Robonomics Parachain work. During the first lesson, your address was added to the course IoT subscription, and you have already managed to use it twice: when you looked for your reflection in the black mirror and when handed in your test results.\n\n## Intro\n\nIn this lesson you will try to control a smart light bulb. Your goal is to turn the bulb on/off using the standard Polkadot/Substrate interface on the Robonomics parachain. The bulb is broadcasting on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkemsNJWaCmvF1Oi50C-hAg/live) so you can watch your result in real time. Also, a more detailed set of instructions regarding using an IoT subscription is available on [our wiki](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/subscription-launch/).\n\n\n## Instructions\n\n<List type=\"numbers\">\n\n<li>\n\nOpen the Robonomics [Polkadot/Substrate portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/extrinsics).\n\nYou should see the Extrinsics (functions in Polkadot ecosystem) menu.If Extrinsics does not open, then using the menu in the top left of the page, navigate to <code> Kusama & Parachains -> Robonomics</code>, and press <code>Switch</code>. Then navigate to <code>Developer</code> in the top header, and then to <code>Extrinsics</code>.\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\nIn the first field where it says \"using the selected account\", pick the same Polkadot.js account that you've used in the previous lessons.\n</li>\n\n<li>\nIn the second field \"submit the following extrinsic\", select <code>rws</code> extrinsics and choose <code>call(subscriptionId, call)</code>. This will allow you to dispatch a function call using the IoT subscription.\n</li>\n\n<li>\nIn the <code>subscriptionId: AccountId32</code> field paste this subscription's owner address: <code>4GgRRojuoQwKCZP9wkB69ZxJY4JprmHtpzEzqJLjnqu4jk1r</code>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\nIn the  <code>call: Call</code> field choose the <code>launch(robot, param)</code> command.\n\nThis will show you two more fields: <code>robot</code> and <code>param</code>.\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\nIn the <code>robot: AccountId32</code> field paste this address of the smart bulb: <code>4DUAnmLeEto197jDDSgvfjfS65MGvReMXibqp9ADg7ZgCDp9</code>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\nIn the <code>param: H256</code> field you need to specify 1 (on) or 0 (off) to turn on/off the bulb.\n\nYou can do this with:\n\n<code>0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001</code>\n\nor\n\n<code>0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</code>\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\nPress the \"Submit Transaction\" button.\n\nDo not forget to open the [broadcast on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkemsNJWaCmvF1Oi50C-hAg/live) before signing the transaction.\n\n</li>\n\n\n</List>\n\n<Result>\n\nThe lesson will be considered completed after sending a successful transaction and its appearance in the Polkadot explorer for your Polkadot.js account.\n\nYou can check your results on [the special checking dapp](https://lk.robonomics.academy/). For authorization on the checking dapp use the same account in Polkadot.js that was used during the course.\n\n</Result>","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/introduction-course/polkadot-ecosystem-for-home-iot-infrastructure.md","name":"polkadot-ecosystem-for-home-iot-infrastructure"},"defaultName":"Introduction to the ideas of Robonomics","lastUpdate":"Thu May 04 2023 12:53:58 GMT+0400 (Samara Standard Time)"}},"context":{}}
