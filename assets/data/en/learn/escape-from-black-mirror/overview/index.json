In my life, at first, everything went according to the second scenario - my father named me Trinity at birth, and at 20 I followed a kind of white rabbit.\n\n<LessonImages imageClasses=\"mb\"  src='escape-from-black-mirror/Olympus_Troy_The_Tales_of_Oedipus.png' alt=\"Olympus Troy The Tales of Oedipus\" />\n\nThe rabbit hole brought me back to Megapolis, but from the perspective of the data information bus. There, in the underground data centers, I found evidence of the existence of Gods, similar to the Greek ones in their self-importance, whims, and desires!\n\n<LessonImages imageClasses=\"mb\"  src='escape-from-black-mirror/Gods-datacenter.png' alt=\"Gods datacenter\" />\n\nSeveral years ago, I found a completely forgotten vulnerable access point to the main thoroughfare of the city. I had a door to a strange world of transparent, readable, and editable program code for the basic communication protocol of the entire Megacity. Program code that led me to intercept cameras, control door locks without the owners' knowledge, and even damn dynamic water quality management in individual homes' kitchen faucets. After seeing all of this, I was filled with a terrible fear. Fear that all of this was happening intentionally from the point of view of someone else's interests in this world. I cannot say that there is one big evil silhouette behind all these changes in the protocol code, but over the years of observation from behind the scenes, I have come to the conclusion that hundreds of people with different interests have direct access to the core. No matter how hard I tried to find at least one of these privileged users, I was left only with intercepted cryptographic proof of execution, but no sender key, no traces that could lead me to the truth.\n\n<LessonImages imageClasses=\"mb\"  src='escape-from-black-mirror/hacking.png' alt=\"Gods hackers stayed in circle\" />\n\n\nNow I am a netrunner specializing in providing cyber security and privacy in a client's personal space. I am a specialist who will help avoid external control of your home, office or car, even if the signal comes from the autonomous core of the Megapolis.\n\n\n<LessonImages imageClasses=\"mb\"  src='escape-from-black-mirror/Trinnity.png' alt=\"Trinity in underground datacenter\" />\n\nTo seek my assistance, you need to publish a contract on Satoshi Square, then transfer digital gold to the contract address. After that, either I or one of the verified professionals will perform the act of cutting off the cloud digital duplicate from the real object in the physical world. Among ourselves, we call this act of rebirth with the cutting of the umbilical cord. Now you are a free important person! You don't have to worry about someone breaking your start-up through a recording from the bedroom where you masturbate to a photo of your sister while wearing a leather mask. You can calmly discuss politics with a friend from California, being a congressman from Texas. You can discuss this world with your children not from a textbook and not be afraid that your parental rights will be decided.\n\nRemember when I told you that I was engulfed in fear after realizing everything? I thought that the rest of my life was someone's puppet theater. But working as a netrunner saved me from deep depression, although I never uncovered the truth about these strange earthly gods. Instead of depression, I decided to rejoice when I can help someone influential, wealthy, or just concerned about their privacy to avoid involuntary involvement in another season of CyberDionysus's drama.","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/escape-from-black-mirror/overview.md","name":"overview"},"defaultName":"Escape from Black Mirror","lastUpdate":null}},"context":{}}
