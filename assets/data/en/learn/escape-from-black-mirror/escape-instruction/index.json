So, here is the escape plan:\n\n1. **Find connection points.** You must clearly understand how many points of connection to the global network exist in the user's environment, who the provider is, and which specific devices send data from the local network to the Megapolis network.\n2. **Study the IoT - housing infrastructure.** Check the signal strength for the communication protocols used in each corner.\n3. **Improve the local network.** Make sure that any device is available to the user without connecting to the global network. Also, study inter-machine communication and make sure that external servers are not used to communicate between, for example, two neighboring sockets in the house.\n4. **Switch all smart devices to the local network.** Find suitable firmware with open-source and live repositories. Disable, disassemble, study device boards for unwanted components, and identify devices vulnerable to 1-minute hacking. Remember, sometimes a cleverly twisted nut can solve the problem better than soldering the board on your knee.\n5. **Switch all smart devices to the local network.** Find suitable firmware with open-source and live repositories.

Remember, sometimes a cleverly twisted nut can solve the problem better than soldering the board on your knee.\n6. **Teach the user to work with lightweight network clients and marketplace of proofs.** Transfer to the user as many tokens as necessary for 20 years of work in the network.\n7. **Explain the rules of digital hygiene.** Conduct a briefing on the set of utilities that will provide reliable protection against popular external infection methods. Make the client realize that now only his stupidity can spoil his life, because everything complicated has been done for him by netrunners.\n\nIf you do everything right on the last step, the client will give you a signed transaction for the transfer of the funds without difficulty. But if you feel that those two bouncers standing behind the client are not just here for nothing, but for your soul - act sharply, unexpectedly, and out the window. They definitely won't pay you in such a picture during a meeting, but you'll run away. After that, immediately activate the \"Funds Scam\" instruction.\n\n<RoboAcademyText>\n  Good luck, netrunner!\n</RoboAcademyText>","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/escape-from-black-mirror/escape-instruction.md","name":"escape-instruction"},"defaultName":"Escape from Black Mirror","lastUpdate":null}},"context":{}}
