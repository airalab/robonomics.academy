As a mother, wife, and workaholic, I began to realize that I needed moments of rest and recovery because energy tends to run out. As someone who loves gadgets and has been a longtime owner of a smart home, I wanted this solution to be automated - practical, comfortable, pleasant, and time-saving for something more useful and productive :) And since I've been interested in AI progress lately, I wanted to experiment and combine the useful and the enjoyable.\n\nToday, many people already have a smart home system, but not everyone understands the specifics and problems. Therefore, I decided to analyze the current situation using AI and a Fake Housewife who will start her story from ground zero with minimal knowledge.\n\n- Describe a personal problem\n- Come up with a solution to it\n- Study the specifics of smart homes and the problems associated with them\n- Understand the technologies involved\n- Learn about the process of connecting devices and the level of difficulty involved\n- Devise a customized automation scenario\n- Attempt to install home automation\n- Choose the right smart devices and where to purchase them\n- Determine where additional specialist help is needed\n- Ultimately solve the problem\n\nConsidering the trend of continuous development of artificial intelligence (AI), but not yet reaching perfection, some tasks may remain unresolved for our Fake Housewife. Therefore, this guide will be dynamic, and I will inform you of updates in our channels and on Twitter. Unresolved issues will be marked as \"under investigation\" by the Fake Housewife, but you can join in the discussion and help her with your AI character â€” she will be glad for the assistance.\n\nDiscussion of this guide can be conducted in our Discord chat #robonomics-academy with a tag and in our Telegram chats.\n\nI hope that this guide will help you solve personal tasks for generating creative scenarios for your home and setting up automation for a sovereign smart home using Robonomics as an example. If you are new to the topic, the guide will provide an opportunity to understand the issues and make the right decision when choosing a smart home system.\n\nLearn, experiment, and share your results on Twitter with the tag [#RobonomicsSpringSchool2023](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RobonomicsSpringSchool2023?src=hashtag_click).\n\nComponents of our AI housekeepers:\n\n- **ChatGPT** - finding solutions to problems, studying terminology, and even creating a name for the AI housekeeper\n- **AutoGPT** - researching issues and their solutions, studying automation, searching for devices and additional specialists\n- **[synthesia.io](https://www.synthesia.io/)** - dynamic image of the AI housekeeper\n- **Midjourney** - illustrations\n- **NotionAI** - the ability to communicate in different languages with correct formulations.\n\nSo let's meet our  Fake Desperate Housewife & AI!","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/fake-housewife-and-ai-research-smart-home-solution/overview.md","name":"overview"},"defaultName":"Fake Housewife & AI research Smart Home Solution","lastUpdate":null}},"context":{}}
