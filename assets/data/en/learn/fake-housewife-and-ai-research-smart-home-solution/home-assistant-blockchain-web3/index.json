Install Home Assistant: The first step is to install Home Assistant on your device. You can visit the official Home Assistant website for instructions.\n\n2. Install the Web3.js library: Web3.js is a JavaScript library that enables interaction with Ethereum blockchain. You can install it directly into your Home Assistant environment using Node.js.\n\n3. Install the Ethereum client: An Ethereum client is necessary to interact with the Ethereum network. Some options include Geth, Parity, or Infura. You will need to create an account with the client and obtain an API key to be able to send transactions.\n\n4. Configure the environment: Once you have everything installed, it is time to configure your Home Assistant environment. You will need to set up the Web3.js provider, Ethereum client integration, and configure your Smart Contracts.\n\n5. Smart Contract Integration: Smart Contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written in code. You can deploy your own Smart Contracts to the Ethereum network and interact with them using Web3.js.\n\n6. Test and deploy: It is important to test your integration before deploying it widely. Once you have tested everything and are satisfied with the integration, you can deploy it to your smart home.\nInstructions on how to connect a smart home to blockchain and web3 with home assistant using Robonomics:\n- **Visit [https://github.com/airalab/homeassistant-robonomics-integration](https://github.com/airalab/homeassistant-robonomics-integration) and read the instructions**\n\n- **Follow the outlined installation and configuration process to connect the home assistant to blockchain and web3 using Robonomics.**\n\n</RoboAcademyTerminal>\n\nSee all process **[here](https://www.notion.so/Process-AUTO-GPT-2-2-5c4ad9df8a0d473eb62ea23461de4c49)**\n\nZoe finds information about the process of setting up and connecting Home Assistant to blockchain and Web3 using Robonomics.

The platform is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to enable communication and coordination between robots and other participants in the network. The main goal of Robonomics is to create a market for robot labor, where robots can autonomously offer and fulfill demand for work, without the need for human intervention. This will enable a new generation of industrial and consumer applications, and has the potential to fundamentally transform the way we work and live.\n\nRobonomics Network is a decentralized platform for integrating economically efficient and self-regulated interaction of users and devices. Robonomics Network allows to build decentralized economy protocols for blockchain and IoT. Through Robonomics, people can purchase digital assets, including transportation, communication and actual real-time data and services; all while ensuring the increasing precision, reliability and security of sensors and automated systems operating in our daily lives.\n\n</RoboAcademyTerminal>\n\nSee all process **[here](https://www.notion.so/Process-AUTO-GPT-2-3e1c2a7ab4dc4982af661fec846a493f)**\n\n\n## Asking Auto-GPT about Robonomics updates for 2022 and 2023\n\n<RoboAcademyTerminal title=\"Goals\">\n\n**AI Name:** Нousewife\n\nНousewife is: ai agent woman designed to autonomously conducting research on the internet and doing independent first-person reporting and storytelling\n\n**Goal 1:**  Find and study <u>current information for 2022 and 2023 and updates in the project about Robonomics , Robonomics network</u> and and create the text file\n\n</RoboAcademyTerminal>\n\n<RoboAcademyTerminal title=\"Research result\">\n\nRobonomics  Network Information:\n\n- Robonomics Network is a decentralized platform that connects IoT devices and blockchain technology.\n- It is built on the Polkadot Relay Chain, which allows for high scalability and interoperability.\n- The Network token is XRT, and it is used for transactional purposes on the network.\n- The network recently announced the release of its parachain, which helps improve scalability and provide a high degree of security.\n-  According to the Robonomics Network website, the network has about 10.5m $XRT locked.\n- The Network has carried out several crowdloan campaigns, with the latest held in November 2022, to fund projects on the network.\n- The Network recently gave an update in March 2023 about its parachain and scalability.\n- There are several exchanges where $XRT can be traded, such as Coinbase.\n- The Robonomics Network Twitter handle is @AIRA_Robonomics.\n\nReferences\n\n1. https://robonomics.network/\n2. https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics\n\n</RoboAcademyTerminal>\n\nSee all process **[here](https://www.notion.so/Process-AUTO-GPT-2-1c3eb42e9dc941aca7b90e5d499204eb)**\n\n\n## Asking Auto-GPT about Robonomics smart home setup\n\n<RoboAcademyTerminal title=\"Goals\">\n\n**AI Name:** Нousewife\n\nНousewife is: ai agent woman designed to autonomously conducting research on the internet and doing independent first-person reporting and storytelling\n\n**Goal 1:** <u> Find links to the course and instructions for connecting sovereign smart home Robonomics</u> and create the text file\n\n</RoboAcademyTerminal>\n\n<RoboAcademyTerminal title=\"Research result\">\n\nHere is the link to the Robonomics smart home course: **[https://robonomics.academy/learn/smart-home-course/overview/](https://robonomics.academy/learn/smart-home-course/overview)** and the instructions for connecting the sovereign smart home Robonomics: **[https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-network/blob/master/README.md#how-to-setup-sovereign-smart-home](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-network/blob/master/README.md#how-to-setup-sovereign-smart-home)**\n\n</RoboAcademyTerminal>\n\nSee all process **[here](https://www.notion.so/Process-AUTO-GPT-13-5-2-f160f5688e13441086dafebaa8d65c89)**\n\n\n## Asking Auto-GPT about Robonomics smart home publications\n\n<RoboAcademyTerminal title=\"Goals\">\n\n**AI Name:** Нousewife\n\nНousewife is: ai agent woman designed to autonomously conducting research on the internet and doing independent first-person reporting and storytelling\n\n**Goal 1:** Find <u>articles and publications about smart home Robonomics</u> and create the text file \n\n</RoboAcademyTerminal>\n\n<RoboAcademyTerminal title=\"Research result\">\n\nhttps://robonomics.network/blog/robonomics-town-hall-2022/\n\nhttps://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/hass-os-upgrade/\n\nhttps://robonomics.network/blog/trajectory-2022-heading-for-product-launches/\n\nhttps://github.com/airalab/robonomics-wiki/issues\n\nhttps://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/sls-gateway/\n\nhttps://github.com/airalab/homeassistant-robonomics-integration\n\nhttps://moonbeam.network/announcements/robonomics-xcm-integration/\n\nhttps://github.com/orgs/airalab/repositories?language=python&type=all\n\n</RoboAcademyTerminal>\n\nSee all process **[here](https://www.notion.so/Process-AUTO-GPT-13-7-1-6ce630949ad343a0a9c095b6442355d3)**\n\n<RoboAcademyText>\n\nIn total, Zoe the housewife was able to study all the information about smart homes, and she found a solution for a safe smart home.
