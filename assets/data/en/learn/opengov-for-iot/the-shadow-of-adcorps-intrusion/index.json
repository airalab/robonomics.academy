The villagers, armed with their smartphones and a specially designed application, could easily vote in referendums, participating in the decisions that shaped their lives.\n\n## Slippery proposals are coming\n\nOn this most unfortunate of days, a wealthy businessman named Craig, known for his abrasive demeanor and unpopularity views, put forth a referendum. This proposal suggested that the common good interactive digital signage, once a beacon of community news and local events, would now display advertisements, generating revenue for the village. \n\nAs fate would have it, the villagers, preoccupied with their daily routines, paid little heed to the referendum's details. With barely a whisper of opposition, Craig's proposal slipped through the cracks and was approved. Unbeknownst to the villagers, the cost of advertising had been set remarkably low, a cunning maneuver by Craig to secure years' worth of advertising for his company, AdCorp.\n\n## Confront the darkness of AdCorp\n\nSoon enough, the interactive digital signage that once showcased stories of village life and shared news, now bore the relentless barrage of AdCorp advertisements. The villagers, dismayed by the sudden change, found themselves yearning for the days when their screens reflected the spirit of Orwellham, rather than the relentless presence of their unwelcome guest, AdCorp.\n\nAs the sun dipped beneath the horizon and the village was bathed in the soft glow of the streetlights, whispers of discontent began to ripple through the community. The villagers, once united in their pursuit of harmony and progress, now faced the challenge of reclaiming their cherished interactive digital signage, a symbol of their village's identity.\n\nThe tale of Orwellham had taken an unexpected turn, but the indomitable spirit of the villagers would not be so easily quelled. As they gathered around the fire, a sense of determination flickered in their eyes, igniting a burning resolve to confront the darkness cast by Craig's AdCorp, and restore the balance that made Orwellham the enchanting village it once was.\n\n<RoboAcademyText>\nto be continued...\n</RoboAcademyText>","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/opengov-for-iot/the-shadow-of-adcorps-intrusion.md","name":"the-shadow-of-adcorps-intrusion"},"defaultName":"OpenGov for managing the IoT infrastructure","lastUpdate":"Wed May 10 2023 10:57:05 GMT+0400 (Samara Standard Time)"}},"context":{}}
