Feecc is a platform that allows enterprises to build and customize their own monitoring system for production or service processes to suit their needs. It is developed by [Multi-Agent Systems](http://multi-agent.io/) using technologies, that Robonomics team provides. The course provides basic knowledge of Feeccâ€™s architecture, including a demo scenario, and explains how to deploy and use this system. \n\n## Who is this course for?\n\nThe course is intended for employees of enterprises who have decided to implement the Feecc production tracking system, as well as for senior engineering managers who are looking for new technological solutions to improve the quality of work processes.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe course materials assume basic production engineering skills, as well as skills in UNIX-based systems. Basic knowledge of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is welcome.\n\n## Main concept\n\nUsing Web3 technology and a set of flexible software modules, the Feecc platform allows companies to organize the production process of any type of product, audit employee access to the workplace and retrieve all workflow data. Information is stored in an unchanged and secure distributed IPFS storage, data hashes are saved with Robonomics datalog module with access for the quality control department via Feecc Analytics. With Feecc, a company can not only digitize its processes and get rid of paperwork and lawsuits, but also attract the attention of new customers to the product, increasing trust in it.\n\nThe platform is a set of software for monitoring the production process and collecting information for subsequent analysis by the QCD or other participants. Globally, the scheme of platform integration into the business process can be represented as follows:\n\n<LessonImages src=\"feecc-course/feecc-scheme.jpg\" alt=\"A scheme of Feecc integration into the business process\"/>\n\n## Platform Opportunities\n\n- **Reliable and secure data storage**: Feecc uses a secure data storage based on a content-addressable architecture and a distributed registry to ensure the reliability and validity of collected workflow data.\n\n- **A clear link between the employee and the product**: Feecc monitors all phases of the workflow with video recording, data logging from peripheral devices and employee access authorization. The platform supports any sequential workflow, including long-term or interrupted operations.\n\n- **Digital product certificate**: All digital traces of the workflow are summarized in a single product certificate with a unique identifier which is then attached as a QR code to the product. Feecc can add custom process parameters to the certificate and automate its creation even for composite parts.\n\n- **Extensive support for peripheral devices**: Feecc supports standard digital I/O interfaces for connecting various devices (video cameras, scanners, printers, etc.).\n\nhttps://youtu.be/WhtOJtGjAok","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/feecc-course/overview.md","name":"overview"},"defaultName":"Getting Used to Feecc","lastUpdate":null}},"context":{}}
