All it has to do is find relevant works on the Internet, obtain their text in some form, and analyze it. However, a significant number of pitfalls have been found in this task, which will be discussed further.\n\n\n## First attempt\n\nLet's start with a simpler task. Using the existing Introduction text, we will add to it relevant references and citations to confirm the relevance of the statements. The initial request for ChatGPT and Bing Chat looks like this (be sure to specify the number of sources):\n\n<RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nAdd 10 references and quotes for Introduction part to support the statements in the text.\n</RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nBoth chatbots were able to correctly place the sources within the text... but completely failed at actually finding the real sources. The problem is that the AI assistants started inventing non-existent sources (but very similar to real ones), adding them to the text and even quoting fictional authors:\n\n<RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nC. Li et al. \"Blockchain-based secure and trustworthy data sharing scheme for smart homes.\" IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, vol. 16, no. 2, pp. 1236-1245, 2020.\n\n\"The deployment of smart home systems has led to concerns over data security and privacy. Blockchain technology has been proposed as a solution to these concerns, as it enables secure and trustworthy data sharing among smart home devices. This paper proposes a blockchain-based secure and trustworthy data sharing scheme for smart homes. The proposed scheme uses blockchain to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data generated by smart home devices.\"\n\n</RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nNotice how natural it looks: the bibliographic format is followed, a real IEEE journal is cited. The only thing that saves it from being used is checking on Google Scholar.\n\n<RoboAcademyNote title=\"Warning\" type=\"warning\">\n Always double-check the links, quotes, and sources provided by the AI assistant.\n</RoboAcademyNote>\n\nThis problem is called [the hallucination effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)), and currently it is causing a lot of controversy among experts in artificial intelligence. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that hallucinations can occur at a level where verification would be too costly (for example, AI may describe in detail a complex hydrodynamic phenomenon that does not actually exist), which undermines all the help of AI services due to their unreliability.\n\nFor comparison, here is the statistics from various services:\n\n- ChatGPT: 9 out of 10 sources are fake\n- Bing Chat: 7 out of 10 sources are fake\n- Auto-GPT: Did not complete the task because it started developing a parser for bibliographic websites for some reason.\n\nIt is noticeable that an AI service works better if it has access to the Internet, but at the same time, it can create a direct link to a non-existent source. Of course, the overall result is not impressive, but let's continue keeping this problem in mind.\n\n## Clarifying requests\n\nAfter several attempts, the best tactic turned out to be asking for sources, feeding the Introduction text paragraph by paragraph. In addition, it was found that AI prefers to provide sources from articles in blogs, forums, and regular websites, instead of scientific papers. Therefore, it is worth specifying specific sources (IEEE, Springer journals, arXiv web archive, etc.) from which the assistant should choose articles:\n\n<RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nFind 5 scientific sources that prove statements in this text. Use only arXiv, IEEE, Springer articles from 2018 to 2023: \"THE_PARAGRAPH\"\n</RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nThis request was only made for Bing Chat, as ChatGPT did not handle the task well due to lack of Internet access. The results turned out to be much better: Bing Chat sometimes provided all the real sources and even provided a brief description, explaining which statement of text the source supports. However, Bing Chat failed to create a bibtex record for the found sources (again producing hallucinations), so manual use of Google Scholar was required at the end.\n\n\n## Moving to literature review\n\nNow we can move on to the more complex task — a full literature search for the second section of the bachelor's thesis. First, let's follow the plan and write two subsections on the following topics:\n\n<RoboAcademyDialog>\n\n&mdash; Overview of smart home technology and its security and privacy issues\n<br/>&mdash; Introduction to web3 technology and its potential benefits for smart homes\n</RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nThe following request was used:\n\n<RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nWrite a literature review with \"THE_TOPIC\" in 300 words. Write as if you are writing part of a technical scientific article.\n</RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nThe last clarification about the style was added because the AI by default writes text that is more suitable for publication in a blog. The first result obtained was not very impressive, it contained too many unnecessary details, such as advertising smart devices from Amazon. Nevertheless, the result can be used as a plan for this subsection, with subsequent additional requests. Eventually, the following structure was achieved:\n\n- Description of smart home technology\n- Examples of devices and their use cases\n- Existing problems of smart home technology\n- Examples of solutions aimed at addressing these problems:\n- Disadvantages of existing solutions\n\nOverall, the obtained text can be used for a bachelor's thesis. A similar process was done with the second topic on web3 technologies, and then corresponding sources were found for each subsection, following the scheme described above.\n\n## Finding articles for analysis\n\nStandard tactics for analysis involve finding 5-10 of the most relevant and cited works on the topic using powerful bibliographic search services (Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar). Let's try to do this using the following request:\n\n<RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nFind five most cited technical scientific articles about developing a smart home systems based of web3 or blockchain or smart contract among IEEE, Springer and arXiv articles from 2020 to 2023\n</RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nUnfortunately, the results are not of good quality:\n\n- ChatGPT emphasized that it doesn't have access to the Internet and is limited to information up to 2021. All five sources suggested were non-existent.\n- Bing Chat found 3 real sources instead of 5, but unfortunately 1) only two of them were on topic, 2) they were not the most cited (one of them had no quotes at all), 3) in some cases the sources were fake (the AI even provide the number of citations for them).\n- Auto-GPT turned out to be the most accurate in terms of the given topic, but was unable to select the most cited articles, even after clarifying that Google Scholar should be used for this task.\n\nUnfortunately, specialized literary search for scientific articles is not yet within the capabilities of these AI services, so it is easier and faster to find the top 5 most cited articles using Google Scholar.\n\n## Bruteforce analysis of related works\n\nAfter this, one way or another, we need to obtain the full texts of the found articles. In the usual case, we would have to read each of them personally, but we will try to request a summary text from AI assistants. We will immediately encounter problems:\n\n1) Articles are usually available in PDF format, most often with two-column texts. Chatbots simply cannot read PDF files, and Auto-GPT currently cannot read this format (but it tried to find a solution to this problem on its own, albeit unsuccessfully!)\n\n<RoboAcademyTerminal title=\"AutoGPT Terminal\">\n\n**SYSTEM:**  Command read_file returned: Error: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 10: invalid continuation byte\nTHOUGHTS:  It looks like I am encountering an encoding issue while trying to open the edgechain PDF file. I can try to extract text from the PDF using the 'tika' library and analyze the contents. I'll use the 'execute_shell' command to install the 'tika' library before using it to extract text from the PDF file.\n\n**REASONING:**  Due to encoding issues trying to read the PDF file, I need a different approach to read the contents of the PDF file in order to analyze and summarize the article.\n\n</RoboAcademyTerminal>\n\nAnyway, PDF articles will have to be converted to a plain text format (without images and tables). To do this, you can use software such as [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [GROBID](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction/), and [PDFMiner](https://pdfminersix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n2) There is a much more serious problem that essentially prevents the use of these AI tools for analyzing entire articles. Unfortunately, in its current form, GPT has a limited context length, which causes Auto-GPT to simply refuse to start the analysis, and chatbots lose the beginning of the conversation:\n\n<RoboAcademyTerminal title=\"AutoGPT Terminal\">\n\nopenai.error.InvalidRequestError: This model's maximum context length is 8191 tokens, however you requested 15615 tokens (15615 in your prompt; 0 for the completion). Please reduce your prompt; or completion length.\n\n</RoboAcademyTerminal>\n\n## Step-by-step analysis of related works\n\nTherefore, we will use a little trickery and run articles through AI page by page, each time requesting a short summary of the received text. Then we will gather these summaries together and get the final analysis of the article. To do this, we can use even ChatGPT, for example, one of the results:\n\n<RoboAcademyDialog>\n\n<ChatGPT/>\n\nEdgeChain: An Edge-IoT Framework and Prototype Based on Blockchain and Smart Contracts\n\nThis article describes EdgeChain, a framework, which addresses scalability and security challenges in the Internet of Things domain by leveraging edge computing, blockchain technology, and smart contracts. Authors highlight the weaknesses of IoT devices and centralized cloud computing and proposes edge computing as a solution. The framework employs a permissioned blockchain and an internal currency system to connect IoT devices with edge cloud resources. Smart contracts enforce regulations and automate policy enforcement.\n\nThe paper outlines the key features of the EdgeChain framework, including permissioned blockchain, credit-based resource management, smart contract enforcement, compatibility with legacy devices, and distributed deployment options. It explains the modules of the framework, such as the IoT Proxy, smart contracts interface, blockchain server, and application interface.\n\nFurthermore, the text delves into the deployment of blockchain, development of smart contracts, device registration, and IoT behavior regulation within the EdgeChain framework. It emphasizes thorough testing, legacy device support, and monitoring of device behaviors for policy enforcement.\n\nOverall, the EdgeChain framework shows promise in addressing scalability and security challenges in the IoT domain through the integration of edge computing, blockchain, and smart contracts. The prototype evaluation indicates its potential as a secure and distributed platform for future IoT applications.\n\n</RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nNext, we need to repeat the same analysis process for the remaining articles, and voila, we have a complete literature review for our bachelor's thesis. In the end, we were required to select the best articles, extract their texts, and verify the AI-generated results before compiling them into a coherent text along with references. The entire task took about 2 days instead of the standard 2-3 weeks.\n\n<RoboAcademyText>\n\nNow we can proceed to the essence of the thesis — the description of the Methods of our work.\n\n</RoboAcademyText>","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/ai-based-bachelor-thesis/writing-literature-review.md","name":"writing-literature-review"},"defaultName":"Quickstart Your Bachelor's Thesis with AI-powered Tools","lastUpdate":null}},"context":{}}
