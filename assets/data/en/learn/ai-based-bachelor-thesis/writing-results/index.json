Can AI tools help with this task? The answer is obviously yes, but with some nuances.\n</RoboAcademyText>\n\n## Data representation and transformation\n\nPerhaps processing and presenting raw data is what AI assistants do best. In a previous guide, we successfully created a UML diagram using AI, but in general, any structured array of data can easily be turned into a diagram or table with some statistics. For example, ChatGPT was tasked with counting the number of successful datalog transactions from a smart home and distributing them by hour based on raw data from the Robonomics parachain on [Subscan](https://robonomics.subscan.io/). Here's an part of the resulting output:\n\n| Hour  | Successful Transactions | Total Transactions | Percentage of Success |\n|-------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| 13:00 | 4                       | 4                  | 100%                  |\n| 14:00 | 5                       | 5                  | 100%                  |\n| 15:00 | 6                       | 6                  | 100%                  |\n| 16:00 | 5                       | 5                  | 100%                  |\n| 17:00 | 5                       | 5                  | 100%                  |\n| 18:00 | 6                       | 6                  | 100%                  |\n\nChatGPT not only counted the number of transactions per hour, but also derived their percentage. \n\n## Deep analysis\n\nBut what if we ask AI to do a deeper analysis based on unstructured data? Unfortunately, here begin the problems we have already encountered: context limitations and hallucinations. As an example, the log files from the Home Assistant of the smart home created earlier were taken, and the following request was formulated for ChatGPT:\n\n<RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nBased this logs of smart home system, write section called \"Analysis of IoT Hub Logs\" in 1000 words. Add precise statistics of occurrences of found events and recommendations for solution of found problems.\n\n</RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nThe logs look something like this (about 500 lines of logs in total):\n\n<LessonCodeWrapper language=\"bash\" noCopyIcon noLines codeClass=\"big-code\">\n    2023-05-29 14:17:18.301 DEBUG (MainThread) [custom_components.robonomics] Time changed: 2023-05-29 14:17:18.299347+00:00\n    2023-05-29 14:17:18.309 DEBUG (MainThread) [custom_components.robonomics.get_states] Start getting info about dashboard and services\n    2023-05-29 14:17:18.321 DEBUG (SyncWorker_0) [custom_components.robonomics.ipfs] Getting last file hash from /ha_robonomics_config with prefix config-\n    2023-05-29 14:17:18.341 DEBUG (SyncWorker_0) [custom_components.robonomics.ipfs] Last /ha_robonomics_config file config-1685367962.12049, with hash QmbQ4STfozcCPeHpKkcrH26hNTnupU1o4LD1JQTFWKpran\n    2023-05-29 14:17:18.352 DEBUG (SyncWorker_10) [custom_components.robonomics.ipfs] Read data from local file: /ha_robonomics_config/config-1685367962.12049\n    2023-05-29 14:17:19.439 DEBUG (MainThread) [custom_components.robonomics.get_states] Got states to send datalog\n    2023-05-29 14:17:21.469 DEBUG (SyncWorker_9) [custom_components.robonomics.ipfs] Time from the last pin: 1:07:04.863542\n    2023-05-29 14:17:21.469 DEBUG (SyncWorker_9) [custom_components.robonomics.ipfs] Telemetry must not be pinned\n    2023-05-29 14:17:21.471 DEBUG (SyncWorker_1) [custom_components.robonomics.ipfs] Getting last file hash from /ha_robonomics_telemetry with prefix None\n    2023-05-29 14:17:21.491 DEBUG (SyncWorker_1) [custom_components.robonomics.ipfs] Last /ha_robonomics_telemetry file data-1685369332.9767303, with hash QmNY2kPBA4Xi2L2DjTWzqhRk5BXS5KyDqjvtYb8mcA43mx\n    2023-05-29 14:17:21.492 DEBUG (SyncWorker_4) [custom_components.robonomics.ipfs] Start adding /tmp/data-1685369841.445844 to local node, pin: False\n    2023-05-29 14:17:21.631 DEBUG (SyncWorker_4) [custom_components.robonomics.ipfs] File /tmp/data-1685369841.445844 was added to local node with cid: QmdmmUXEvmtW1UnttcEDhc8pee8CwVdEFH4aax9XZj76m8\n    2023-05-29 14:17:21.692 DEBUG (SyncWorker_4) [custom_components.robonomics.ipfs] File data-1685369332.9767303 with was unpinned\n    2023-05-29 14:17:27.165 DEBUG (SyncWorker_6) [custom_components.robonomics.ipfs] Actual balance in crust network - 604385098\n    2023-05-29 14:17:28.617 DEBUG (SyncWorker_6) [custom_components.robonomics.ipfs] approximate cost to store the file - 1000067848\n    2023-05-29 14:17:28.617 WARNING (SyncWorker_6) [custom_components.robonomics.ipfs] Not enough account balance to store the file in Crust Network\n    2023-05-29 14:17:28.634 DEBUG (MainThread) [custom_components.robonomics.robonomics] Send datalog states request, another datalog: False\n    2023-05-29 14:17:28.638 DEBUG (SyncWorker_0) [custom_components.robonomics.robonomics] Start creating rws datalog\n    2023-05-29 14:17:55.573 DEBUG (SyncWorker_0) [custom_components.robonomics.robonomics] Datalog created with hash: 0x396f26a5e3fdaa89910e7f78491f90150d6f9e59e9c7e85f6b9d090ade235077\n    2023-05-29 14:19:40.007 WARNING (MainThread) [custom_components.local_luftdaten.sensor] REST request error: Cannot connect to host 192.168.13.141:80 ssl:default [Connect call failed ('192.168.13.141', 80)]\n\n</LessonCodeWrapper>\n\nIn response, the AI tool often began to hallucinate, offering an analysis of apparently different, non-existent data:\n\n<RoboAcademyDialog>\n\n<ChatGPT/>\n\nThe logs revealed a significant number of connectivity issues encountered by the IoT devices. Out of a total of 10,000 recorded events, 1,200 (12%) were related to connectivity problems.\n\n...\n\nThe analysis identified a notable number of unauthorized access attempts to the smart home system. Approximately 300 (3%) events were logged, indicating potential security breaches. These attempts could lead to unauthorized control or access to sensitive information within the smart home.\n\n...\n\nThe logs revealed a lack of regular firmware updates for the IoT devices, with only 20 (0.2%) events indicating successful updates. This finding raises concerns regarding the security and performance of the devices.\n\n</RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nIn other cases, the AI lost context. For example, the following request was made for Subscan transaction logs:\n\n<RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nAnalyze the logs below and tell me what kind of Smart Home System analysis can be done on them. These are the transaction logs for the SUB_CONTROLLER address received from the Robonomics parachain, related to the subscription IoT.\n\n</RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nDespite the fact that the AI was specifically re-fed with the context of the bachelor's thesis and the text of the smart home online course, it still generated a misleading answer with data that simply did not exist in the logs:\n\n<RoboAcademyDialog>\n\n<ChatGPT/>\n\nUser Behavior Analysis:\n\nAnalyzing the logs provided insights into user behavior within the Smart Home System. By examining the transaction details, we observed the following user behavior patterns:\n- Most Frequently Used Features: Lighting control was the most frequently used feature, accounting for 45% of total transactions. Temperature control followed closely with 30% of total transactions, while security system monitoring and appliance automation accounted for 15% and 10% respectively.\n- Usage Patterns: Users tended to interact with the Smart Home System more frequently during weekdays compared to weekends. This suggests that the system is primarily utilized for regular daily activities, such as lighting and temperature control, rather than special occasions or leisure activities.\n\n</RoboAcademyDialog>\n\nOverall, the use of AI assistants for writing the Results section can be considered more unsuccessful than successful. Yes, AI can help present and process data, but in essence, it saves very little time compared to classic data science tools. Additionally, users need to constantly worry about the accuracy of the provided answers and double-check them.\n\n<RoboAcademyText fWeight=\"500\">\nNow we can move on to the final section of our bachelor's thesis â€” Conclusions, where we will not only finish writing the thesis, but also make overall conclusions on the use of AI for this purpose.\n</RoboAcademyText>","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/ai-based-bachelor-thesis/writing-results.md","name":"writing-results"},"defaultName":"Quickstart Your Bachelor's Thesis with AI-powered Tools","lastUpdate":null}},"context":{}}
