You will study the first half of the second chapter of Robonomics Whitepaper 2022 titled **Robonomics Architecture**. Particularly, we explore some of the practical questions and challenges surrounding creating a well-functioning IoT system. We explore these questions because this is the only way that we can understand the requirements for such IoT platforms as Robonomics.\n\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"container__reg\">\n\n## You will learn:\n\n<List>\n\n<li>\na quick overview of the current state of IoT systems and its typical components;\n</li>\n\n<li>\nabout modern concept for building IoT systems â€” the digital twin;\n</li>\n\n<li>\ncurrent problems of building IoT solutions;\n</li>\n\n<li>\nand how Robonomics architecture adapts to the needs of the modern Internet of Things.\n</li>\n\n</List>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"container__reg\">\n\n## Instructions\n\n<List type=\"numbers\">\n\n<li>\n\nRead the first half of the second chapter of Whitepaper 2022 on our [website](hhttps://robonomics.network/architecture/).\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\nAfter reading, try to pass [the test](https://lesson4.robonomics.academy/) for the fourth lesson in the special dapp.\n\nYou will be asked 11 questions; to pass the test, you need to score 7 correct answers out of 11 (60%, the standard value in academic practice).\n\nTry to get as many correct answers as possible, if you pass the test by 90% in two attempts you will get bonus tokens for Lesson 5.\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\nSimply mark your answers in the dapp and at the end click on the \"Sign and send\" button.\n\nYou need to use the same Polkadot.js account for the test dapp that you used in the previous lesson.\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\nAs in the previous lesson, sign your transaction and check it on the Polkadot explorer.\n\n</li>\n</List>\n</section>\n\n\n<Result>\n\nThe lesson will be considered completed after sending a successful transaction and its appearance in the Polkadot explorer for your Polkadot.js account.\n\nYou can check your results on [the special checking dapp](https://lk.robonomics.academy/). For authorization on the checking dapp use the same account in Polkadot.js that was used during the course.\n\n</Result>","fileInfo":{"path":"en/online-courses/introduction-course/4-robonomics-architecture.md","name":"4-robonomics-architecture"},"lessonNumber":4}},"context":{}}
