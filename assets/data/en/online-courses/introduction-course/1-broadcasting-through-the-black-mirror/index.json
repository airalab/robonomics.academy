For this purpose, we created a special dapp called \"Black Mirror Broadcast\", that works just from your web browser and shows a stream with a small retro TV. The dapp can remotely control the TV and change a QR code by sending your message using Robonomics platform.\n\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"container__reg\">\n\n## Inspiration\n\nWe created this dapp for the purpose of setting the right mood for the rest of the course. The idea of dapp conveys the spirit of a dystopia in which most of a human life exists on a black screen and everyone can spy on this life.\n\nTechnology has inexorably entered the everyday life of humankind and very often technology becomes intertwined with our lives more deeply than some of us would like. There is a long-standing and difficult question from the field of philosophy about the opposition of the public and the private parts of human existence. That is why we, in Robonomics, want to implement web3 tools in the IoT field. We want to make it impossible to instantly change the name of every person on the planet to an identification code without the consent of the person.\n\nNext-generation Internet technologies can help improve the relationship between people and machines, make smart devices more independent and faster in providing services to people, and importantly, make it impossible to take control of all people with the help of machines. This is how we see the best scenario for integrating robots into humans‚Äô daily lives.\n\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"container__reg\">\n\n## Instructions\n\n<List type=\"numbers\">\n\n<li>\n\nInstall the Polkadot.js browser extension and create an account for Robonomics Parachain.\n\nSee the guide on our wiki: [Create Account for Robonomics Parachain](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/create-account-in-dapp/). You need to pass all lessons of the course with one Polkadot account to apply for certificate.\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\nEnter to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/xqDgG3EGm9) and get the \"Developer Community Member\" role. To do this, in the channel \"üëãwelcome-info\" you need to click on the corresponding emoji (‚öõÔ∏è) in the MEE6 bot post.\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\nFind the special [Discord chatbot](https://discord.com/channels/803947358492557312/944186892038053899), called \"üö∞academy-faucet\" in the channel list and enter your Robonomics Parachain address from Polkadot.js extension.\n\nMake sure you send the address to the bot in the correct format (it starts with \"4\"). If the bot does not respond or does not add your address to the subscription the first time, try a few more times, this happens due to network load. If the problem persists, ask in the \"üéìrobonomics-academy\" channel.\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\nGo to the [Black Mirror dapp](https://blackmirror.robonomics.academy) and allow the dapp access to Polkadot.js extension.\n\nMake sure that you select the correct account, that got the free IoT subscription.\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\nEnter in the dapp your short text message (in English) and click on \"Sign and send\" button. \n</li>\n\n<li>\nIn the appeared extension window, enter your password and sign the transaction. \n</li>\n\n<li>\nMake sure that your transaction was successfully sent by checking the link to the Polkadot explorer.\n\nThe <code>Result</code> field should show <code>Success</code>.\n</li>\n\n<li>\nCheck the QR code on the TV screen, it should change (can take up to 2 minutes).\n</li>\n</List>\n</section>\n\n<Result>\n\nThe lesson will be considered completed after sending a successful transaction and its appearance in the Polkadot explorer for your Polkadot.js account.\n\nYou can check your results on [the special checking dapp](https://lk.robonomics.academy/). For authorization on the checking dapp use the same account in Polkadot.js that was used during the course.\n\n</Result>\n","fileInfo":{"path":"en/online-courses/introduction-course/1-broadcasting-through-the-black-mirror.md","name":"1-broadcasting-through-the-black-mirror"},"lessonNumber":1}},"context":{}}
