This integration allows Home Assistant to use Robonomics parachain functions, first of all, send encrypted smart home data to a decentralized cloud.\n\nTo do this, the parachain has a datalog() function that allows you to save device data to the blockchain. To be more precise, the integration uses IPFS to store data and then send IPFS hashes to the datalog function.\n\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"container__reg\">\n\n## Instructions\n\n<List type=\"numbers\">\n\n<li>\n\nAdding Robonomics to Hass\n\n<List>\n\n<li>\n\nIn the web interface of Home Assistant go to <code>Settings/Device & Services</code> and press <code>ADD INTEGRATION</code>. Search for <code>Robonomics</code>.\n\n<LessonImages src=\"smart-house-course/lesson-6-1.jpeg\" alt=\"tutorial\"/>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\nClick on Robonomics and fill in the configuration: \n\n\\- Add seed from the <code>SUB_ADMIN</code> account to admin account seed\n\n\\- Add the public address of the <code>SUB_OWNER</code> account (which you previously created) to the subscription owner address\n\n\\- Set the interval of data sending (by default it is 10 minutes)\n\n\\- (Optional) You can add credentials for pinning service Pinata to spread your data wider over the IPFS network\n\n<LessonImages src=\"smart-house-course/lesson-6-2.jpeg\" alt=\"tutorial\"/>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\nPress <code>SUBMIT</code> after finishing the configuration. If you filled in everything correctly, you will see the Success window.\n\n</li>\n</List>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\nSetting up Users in Robonomics Dapp \n\n<List>\n\n<li>\n\nYou need to create a separate user for Home Assistant, who will control the smart home devices. You cannot use previously created accounts because <code>SUB_OWNER</code> and <code>SUB_ADMIN</code> provide security, and the first user you created when you first started Hass does not have a Robonomics Parachain account.\n\nStart with creating an account on Robonomics Parachain, as you did in the previous lesson.\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\nAdd this account to the subscription in the [dapp](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/subscription/devices). Now there should be three addresses in the access list: <code>sub-owner</code>, <code>sub-admin</code> and <code>user</code>.\n\n<LessonImages src=\"smart-house-course/lesson-6-3.jpeg\" alt=\"tutorial\"/>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\nGo to the dapp service called [Home Assistant Account](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/home-assistant). Choose the account you've just created at the right sidebar (check that you have chosen the intended account by pressing the profile icon).\n\nEnter the <code>USER</code> seed in the required field. Add <code>SUB_OWNER</code> and <code>SUB_ADMIN</code> addresses in the administrator credits fields.\n\n<LessonImages src=\"smart-house-course/lesson-6-4.jpeg\" alt=\"tutorial\" imageClasses=\"mb\"/>\n\nIf everything is correct, you will see verification status <code>VERIFIED</code>.\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\nCreate a password for a new user which you have just registered and then confirm the transaction, that will now be without fee due to the subscription. Later you can restore the password in the <code>Restore</code> tab.\n\n<LessonImages src=\"smart-house-course/lesson-6-5.jpeg\" alt=\"tutorial\"/>\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\nAfter the registration process, log in to Home Assistant with your user address as login and a newly-created password. Now you can use Robonomics dapp to control your home through Robonomics.\n\n<LessonImages src=\"smart-house-course/lesson-6-6.jpeg\" alt=\"tutorial\"/>\n</li>\n</List>\n</li>\n</List>\n</section>","fileInfo":{"path":"en/online-courses/smart-home-course/6-robonomics-integration-setup.md","name":"6-robonomics-integration-setup"},"lessonNumber":7}},"context":{}}
