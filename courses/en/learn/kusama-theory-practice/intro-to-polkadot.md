# Theory: History of Polkadot

We're embarking on our journey into the world of Polkadot and Kusama, where the transformation of the web2.0 into a more decentralized, transparent, and inclusive space has already begun. In this lesson, we will delve into the history of Polkadot which promises to revolutionize the approach to blockchain.

## The Idea and Birth of Polkadot

### What is Polkadot?

**Polkadot** is an innovative open-source project that aims to unlock the full potential of blockchain technology. It’s also a blockchain, but not the way we’re used to see it.  It is **a heterogeneous multichain** with multiple blockchains and other data structures, united in one network.

Being a heterogeneous multichain, Polkadot consist of different purpose-built data structure (or ‘**parachains**’), that can interact and communicate with one another in secure, scalable environment. 

One of the fundamental approaches of Polkadot is concept of [shared security](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains).

**Shared security** basically means that in the Polkadot network, multiple blockchains are interconnected and protected by a common group of **validators**. These **validators** secure the entire network by validating transactions and maintaining consensus. Through a nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus algorithm, validators are chosen based on their stake in the network's native cryptocurrency, DOT. According to this concept, **parachains** can benefit from the established security infrastructure of the Relay Chain. Simply say, they can rely on the already strong and secure infrastructure provided by the Relay Chain. 

Created by Dr. Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, Polkadot seeks to solve the problem of blockchain interoperability, the thing in which Ethereum [is very limited](https://blocking.net/12864/conversation-boca-founder-gavin-wood-i-dont-want-people-to-be-slaves-to-tokens/).

### From concept to a working project

Founder of Polkadot, Dr. Gavin Wood, is a British computer scientist and entrepreneur who is well-known for his contributions to the blockchain industry. He co-founded Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency platform, and wrote the Ethereum Yellow Paper and designed the Solidity scripting language, which is being used for writing smart contracts. Despite everything, Wood didn’t think Ethereum was able to create a truly decentralized ecosystem and [left](https://www.protocol.com/fintech/polkadot-ethereum-gavin-wood) in 2015 due to a vision of creating a scalable, interoperable and secure multi-chain framework that he felt was necessary for the next generation of the internet.

The genesis of Polkadot came from Wood’s recognition of the limitations and challenges faced by Ethereum, and other existing blockchains. While Ethereum tried to solve the interoperability and scalability issues with its smart contract capabilities and decentralized application (dapps), Wood saw the solution in creating framework that could allow for multiple blockchains to interoperate, and maintain robust security. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born.

Streamlined timeline of Polkadot’s journey:

- **2016:** Dr. Gavin Wood conceives the idea of Polkadot, later establishes Parity Technologies to bring the concept to life.
- **2017:** Wood publishes the Polkadot whitepaper titled “Polkadot: Vision for a Heterogenous Muti-Chain Framework”.
- **2017-2019:** Polkadot undergoes development and testing phases.
- **May 2020:** Official launch of the Polkadot Network.
- **2020- Present:** Active growing and evolving.

<robo-academy-note type="okay" title="Interesting fact">
  Wondering why a high-tech blockchain network is named "Polkadot"? The name isn't random! It perfectly captures the project's essence. Just like a polka dot pattern has unique dots, Polkadot houses unique but interconnected parachains. Each "dot" is a unique parachain serving its own purpose while being part of a larger network. The name Polkadot is a playful nod to this diversity and interconnectedness!

## Comparison of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polkadot

Bitcoin appeared in 2008 as a P2P platform, operating without central bank or single administrator. 7 years later Ethereum introduced self-executing smart contracts, which allowed the creation of [decentralized apps (DApps)](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-decentralized-applications-dapps) and let to the [initial coin offering (ICO)](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-ico) boom in 2017. Polkadot got even more advanced with a possibility of interconnecting parachains. What makes it so special, comparing to other gigantic blockchains?

To find that out, we’ll hop on [blockchair.com](https://blockchair.com/), a site to explore and analyze different blockchains.

One of the main reason, why Bitcoin doesn’t being used everywhere, is the amount of transactions per second (tps). For Bitcoin, the average is about 5 tps. Ethereum haven’t gone far away and has around 15 tps. Funny numbers, especially, if you compare that to Visa, which processes 1700 tps in average and is able to process up to 24.000 tps.

Polkadot employs a heterogeneous multichain model where multiple parachains run in parallel. Each parachain operates independently and processes its own transactions. This means multiple transactions can be processed concurrently across various systems, significantly boosting the network’s capacity. The more parachains are added to the network, the number of transactions can be processed increases and each one serves a different purpose of parachains.

## Kusama

If we speaking about the history of the Polkadot network, it is impossible to not mention Kusama. Kusama is often referred to as the "canary network" or the experimental counterpart to Polkadot. It was created as a platform for developers to test and deploy blockchain innovations before implementing them on Polkadot.

Kusama is an independent network, created by the same team behind Polkadot and sharing the same basic architecture as Polkadot: Relay chain, Parachains, Parathreads, etc. The key difference? Kusama is a kind of a playground for developers to test new features and projects in a real-world environment, but with more risk and speed. Think of it as the fast-and-loose, less polished version of Polkadot. 

Kusama has it’s own token - [KSM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kusama/). This token is used for governance, i.e. voting on various proposals, staking and bonding. Little for you to know, this course has been also approved and sponsored via proposal on Kusama.polkassembly. You can check it out here: [click](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/150).

## Polkadot Ecosystem as Future City

For a better understanding of Polkadot network, let’s picture it like a super cool, flexible city of the future!

At the heart of this city, we’ve got the **Relay chain**. It’s like the main highway that keeps everything in Polkadot connected and running smoothly. It’s responsible for the network’s shared security, consensus, and cross-chain interoperability.

Now, branching off this highway, we’ve got the **Parachains.** These are like the unique neighborhoods, each with their own vibes and specialties. They benefit from the security and interoperability of the Relay Chain, but they can do their own thing too.

Then there’s something known as **Parathreads**. Think of these like pop-up stores or food trucks. They’re similar to parachains but they don’t have permanent slot on the Relay Chain. They basically rent space when they need it, making them a flexible and cost-effective option for less active blockchains.

But the magic and futureness isn’t just in the infrastructure. It’s also in how the city is governed. This is where **OpenGov** comes in, which is Polkadot’s unique take on decentralized governance. It’s like a town hall meeting where everyone gets a say on upgrades and changes to the network. **Stakeholders** can propose referenda, and **DOT holders** vote on them. Recent update removed Polkadot Council and the technical committee, and introduced the **Polkadot Fellowship,** as a fully decentralized body to control the network. Read more about OpenGov [here](https://polkadot.network/features/opengov/).

Now, if Polkadot is a futuristic city, **Kusama** is its wild, experimental cousin. It’s like the Burning Man festival near of Polkadot city.

## How can Polkadot and Kusama revolutionize web3?

As we mentioned above, Polkadot, alongside its canary network Kusama, is pioneering a new era of internet interaction. By connecting private, public, permissioned, and permisionless blockchains, Polkadot is driving forward the vision of a truly decentralized and interoperable web3 ecosystem. 

Imagine you’re using the internet today (the web2 world). You sign up for a social media platform and we’ll call it platform A. To do this, you create a username and password, provide your email, etc. The platform A stores all that information on their centralized servers. Every time you upload a picture or post a comment, it’s all going through platform A, so they essentially own your data. They also can shut down your account and you will not have much to do about it.

Now, let’s move into the web3 world, powered by systems like Polkadot and Kusama. Here, you join a new social media platform, let’s call it platform B. But this time, instead of creating a username and password, you use your **digital wallet** to create an account. This wallet is secured by blochain technology and cryptography. 

<robo-academy-note type="note" title="Note">
  In web3, the digital wallet isn’t just a tool to keep your money on. It’s your passport, your ID, and your bank all in one. You also will be able to use your wallet through different parachains, since they are a part of Polkadot or Kusama relay chain. Wallet time!
</robo-academy-note>

On platform B, you’re not just a user, you’re a stakeholder. All your data stored on a decentralized network and can’t be wiped out by some company or government. In fact, all private data in web3 are non-fungible tokens. So, if you want to share your data with someone, you might even get paid for it. Sounds cool, right?

## Conclusion

As we draw our exploration of Polkadot and Kusama to a close, it’s clear that we’re on the cusp on a transformation in how we interact with the digital world. From understanding the Relay chain, Parachains, and Parathreads, to appreciating the experimental spirit of Kusama, we’ve seen how these networks shaking up the blockchain status quo. They stand at the forefront of the transformation from web2 to web3, so if you’re intrigued by web3 world, deepening your understanding of Polkadot is a must. 

So, continue your exploration, question the norms, and dare to dream.
