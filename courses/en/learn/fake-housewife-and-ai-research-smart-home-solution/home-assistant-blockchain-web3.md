We continue to study the problem on behalf of the housewife we invented earlier with artificial intelligence.
</RoboAcademyText>

Zoe has already researched information on current smart home solutions, understood the risks of data security and centralized cloud data storage. She has found a possible solution to the problem through Home Assistant and the possibilities of blockchain and web3 smart home solutions, which can ensure the security of her data and reduce potential risks to her family.

Now she is looking for a solution and instructions on how to connect a smart home with integration of Home Assistant, blockchain, and web3.

**AI Name: Нousewife**

Нousewife is: ai agent woman designed to autonomously conducting research on the internet and doing independent first-person reporting and storytelling

**Goal 1:** Write a list of links to sites with instructions or lessons on connecting a sovereign secure <u>smart home to the blockchain, web3 with home assistant</u> and create the text file

Detailed guide on integrating blockchain Web3 protocol with Home Assistant:

1. Install Home Assistant: The first step is to install Home Assistant on your device. You can visit the official Home Assistant website for instructions.

2. Install the Web3.js library: Web3.js is a JavaScript library that enables interaction with Ethereum blockchain. You can install it directly into your Home Assistant environment using Node.js.

3. Install the Ethereum client: An Ethereum client is necessary to interact with the Ethereum network. Some options include Geth, Parity, or Infura. You will need to create an account with the client and obtain an API key to be able to send transactions.

4. Configure the environment: Once you have everything installed, it is time to configure your Home Assistant environment. You will need to set up the Web3.js provider, Ethereum client integration, and configure your Smart Contracts.

5. Smart Contract Integration: Smart Contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written in code. You can deploy your own Smart Contracts to the Ethereum network and interact with them using Web3.js.

6. Test and deploy: It is important to test your integration before deploying it widely. Once you have tested everything and are satisfied with the integration, you can deploy it to your smart home.
Instructions on how to connect a smart home to blockchain and web3 with home assistant using Robonomics:

Robonomics is a platform for integrating robots into the economy. The platform is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to enable communication and coordination between robots and other participants in the network. The main goal of Robonomics is to create a market for robot labor, where robots can autonomously offer and fulfill demand for work, without the need for human intervention. This will enable a new generation of industrial and consumer applications, and has the potential to fundamentally transform the way we work and live.

Robonomics Network is a decentralized platform for integrating economically efficient and self-regulated interaction of users and devices. Robonomics Network allows to build decentralized economy protocols for blockchain and IoT. Through Robonomics, people can purchase digital assets, including transportation, communication and actual real-time data and services; all while ensuring the increasing precision, reliability and security of sensors and automated systems operating in our daily lives.
